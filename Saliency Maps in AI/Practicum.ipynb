    "The medical field is one that is ever changing, in flux, and always adapting. It makes sense then that it would be quick to adopt Natural language processes when it comes to machine learning. What I propose is a multi-label classification system to help get patients to the departments they need to be in faster. Using NLP of doctor's transcriptions we can identify which department these transcriptions were coming from, thus in the future allowing general practioners to potentially diagnose more readily and help skip certain specialists at times and go directly to surgery. Using a simple Logistic Regression model with the minimal data given we were able to achieve an optimal F1 Score of 42% given 39 different classifiers. "

    "### 2)Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we wanted to do with this data is do an analysis. We start with some basic analysis looking at the dimensions of the data with df.shape(). From here we can see the number of rows and columns but to get more specific we use df.columns() to print out a list of the names. We do this to quickly identify if there are any potential redundancies or irrelevant columns in the data that we'd like to drop. Finally, we look at the dtypes of all the columns to insure they weren't assigned an awkward or wrong dtype. We can then start to analyze the meat of these data. Finding the null values (if any) and dropping / imputing them. We can look for potential input error using df.describe() to identify any strange values / outliers. From this point we have a general idea of what our data holds and how to move forward with cleaning and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in cleaning is to simply remove columns that are no needed. The following columns were dropped:\"Unnamed: 0\", this is just a relic from importing a CSV and holds no value. We were able to identify the amount of null values in the data, specifically in \"Keywords\" and we dealt with that by dropping them, we cannot impute this as it is very specific to each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onwards we can begin processing the textual columns into useable data for our modeling purposes.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Methods\n",
    "Before we move forward we must process our data. Using NLTK and REGEX libraries we were able to clean and create fairly uniform data. This could be done with the Spacy library however I wanted to demonstrate a deeper understand of how this data cleans as well as allow the ability to customize exactly how we wanted this data cleaned. We designed a funtion to clean our data, when the natural language (transcription data) enters our function the following occurs: All float and integer based numbers are removed, all characters are converted to lowercase, we remove non-english characters, we tokenize the words, removed common stop words, we then lemmatize our words (lemmatizing was found to be better than stemming here), and all punctuation was removed as well. This gives us a workable and uniform text. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then engineer some features, this new text being one of those features as well as a sentiment feature using TextBlob \"polarity\", word counts, and character counts. These are done for general data analysis and visualizations. Another engineered feature was the 'medical_class' feature, this is the result of each unique medical_specialty being assigned an integer so that we may use this as a target variable in our modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then began to look at visualizations of our data to see if there was any information to be gleaned. Indeed we could see that polarity was relatively neutral most of the time, which makes sense as a standard visit to the Doctor shouldn't be dire. We checked to see trends in the data with word count and length of the transcriptions and found it was skewed left (not as many words / shorter length.) It seemed most doctors kept their transcriptions short. We were also able to identify our most common words using Countvectorizer/ TFIDF checking both Unigrams (single words) and bigrams (2 words together). Ultimately through testing of different models I did not find that bigrams had a positive impact on prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a class imbalance issue here as well, medical_specialty had a high of over 1000 values for 'surgery'. I found there was not nearly enough data nor time to start testing under/over sampling techniques. Due to the vague nature of 'surgery' and potential overlap with other categories as well I saw it fit to drop these values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using TFIDF we turn our words into features. Essentially vectorizing each word so that we can use it in different modeling techniques. Before doing so we need to transform these features into a sparse format for training using tfidf_transformer. From there we can set our y to our target feature and begin trying different models.\n"

    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics used were accuracy score for overfitting comparisons and ultimately F1_Score for validation of the model. Unigram words were used for these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model tried was Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB). MNB is commonly used in NLP and is quite fast due to its simplicity. Ultimately its results were not optimal. F1 Score of 40%\n",
    "\n",
    "The next model used was Logistic regression. Here we found the best results with an optimal F1 Score of 42%. This model did take longer to run than MNB however this is to be expected due to the simplicity of MNB. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final base model ran was a Random Forest Classifier, this model took by far the longest to run and also gave the worst results with an F1 Score of 29%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bigram models were all run as well but each bigram fared worse than its unigram counterpart and was thus not included in this writeup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these base models we used a deep learning neural network to see if we could have better results. Neural networks love lots of data and we were aware this wasn't nearly enough to produce amazing results however sometimes a neural network can surprise you! A sequential model with Embeddings was used from the Keras package using the Tensorflow backend. It could be seen that accuracy was getting higher and higher as the epochs increased, this however is meaningless as the val_accurace remained at 0 throughout. This implies the nerual network model is simply overfitting and thus giving poor results. A neural network here is not appropriate."

    "Ultimately this was a smaller data set and thus is hard to get amazing results, especially in such a short time frame! I am however happy with the result of 42% with 39 different classifiers involved. Random chance would be ~ 2.5% and so we have significanlty beaten that.\n",
    "Moving forward more data would be key, with more data a neural network could be justified here and would (I believe) give us much better results than even our Logistic Regression model. This work could be very valuable as it could be the start of much more streamlined diagnoses for general practioners using automation in NLP. Again, any time saved here could help save lives and would be more cost efficient for hospitals. The plan here was to build a powerpoint presentation for a more general audience as well but sadly I ran out of time completely. Presentation ability is something I excel at and wanted to show here.
